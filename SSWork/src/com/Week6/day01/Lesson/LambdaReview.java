        Steps we took for slow method
        1. create functional interface
        2. create your implementing class
        3. create an instance of your implementing class
        4. hand the instance in to our method as a parameter

    /*
        Examples: Built-in Functional Interfaces
        - Comparator --- compareTo takes in TWO arguments
        - Predicate --- takes in ONE argument and returns a BOOLEAN
        - Consumer --- a built-in interface that takes ONE argument and returns VOID
        - Supplier --- take in NO Arguments and return ONE value ex: random number generator
        - Function --- takes in ANY type and returns ANY type

        List = used for storing/accessing individual elements
        Stream = used for processing a sequence of data
